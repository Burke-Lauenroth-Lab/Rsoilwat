\title{Extracts daily weather data from a SQLite database}
\usage{
dbW_getWeatherData(Site_id = NULL, lat = NULL, long = NULL,
  Label = NULL, startYear = NULL, endYear = NULL, Scenario = "Current")
}
\arguments{
\item{Site_id}{Numeric. Used to identify site and extract weather data.}

\item{lat}{Numeric. Latitude used with longitude to identify site id if
Site_id is missing.}

\item{long}{Numeric. Longitude and Latitude are used to identify site if
Site_id is missing.}

\item{Label}{A character string.}

\item{startYear}{Numeric. Extracted weather data will start with this year.}

\item{endYear}{Numeric. Extracted weather data will end with this year.}

\item{Scenario}{A character string.}
}
\value{
Returns weather data as list. Each element contains data for one
year.
}
\description{
Reads weather data from database. Returns list of weather data.
}
\details{
Weather data for the soil water simulation run can be stored in the input
data or it can be separate to keep the input data size down for multiple
variations of the same site. This function is used to return the weather
data from a pre defined weather database. Using the database was faster then
reading in multiple weather files from disk.

SOILWAT does not handle missing weather data. If you have missing data, then
you have to impute yourself or use the built-in Markov weather generator
(see examples for \code{\link{sw_exec}}).

The output from this function can be passed directly to sw_exec with input
data.
