# Output setup file for SOILWAT v4 compiled on Mac OS X (20100202)
#
# Notes:
# Time periods available:  DY,WK,MO,YR
#   eg, if DY is chosen then 100,200 would mean to use the second hundred days
#   But if YR is chosen, start and end numbers are in days so only those days
#   are reported for the yearly average.
# Some keys from older versions (fortran and the c versions mimicking the fortran
#   version) are not currently implemented:
#   ALLH20, WTHR.
#
# ESTABL only produces yearly output, namely, DOY for each species requested.
#   Thus, to minimize typo errors, all flags are ignored except the filename.
#   Output is simply the day of the year establishment occurred for each species
#   in each year of the model run.  Refer to the estabs.in file for more info.
#
# DEEPSWC produces output only if the deepdrain flag is set in siteparam.in.
#
# Filename prefixes should not have a file extension.
# Case is unimportant.
#
# SUMTYPEs are one of the following:
#  OFF - no output for this variable
#  SUM - sum the variable for each day in the output period
#  AVG - average the variable over the output period
#  FIN - output value of final day in the period; soil water variables only.
# Note that SUM and AVG are the same if timeperiod = dy.
#
# (3-Sep-03) OUTSEP key indicates the output separator.  This method
# allows older files to work with the new version.  The default is a
# tab.  Other options are 's' or 't' for space or tab (no quotes)
# or any other printable character as itself (eg, :;| etc).  The given
# separator will apply to all of the output files.  Note that only lowercase
# letters 's' or 't' are synonyms.
#
# (01/17/2013) TIMESTEP key indicates which periods you want to output.
# You can output all the periods at a time, just one, or however many
# you want. To change which periods to output type 'dy' for day,
# 'wk' for week, 'mo' for month, and 'yr' for year after TIMESTEP
# in any order. For example: 'TIMESTEP mo wk' will output for month and week
OUTSEP t
